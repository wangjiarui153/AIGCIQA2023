> **Abstract:** *In this paper, in order to get a better understanding of the human visual
preferences for AIGIs, a large-scale IQA database for AIGC is established,
which is named as AIGCIQA2023. We first generate over 2000 images based on 6
state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models using 100 prompts.
  Based on these images, a well-organized subjective experiment is conducted to
assess the human visual preferences for each image from three perspectives
including quality, authenticity and correspondence.
  Finally, based on this large-scale database, we conduct a benchmark
experiment to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art IQA metrics
on our constructed database.*
